      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I’m a 21-year-old <strong>Tech enthusiast</strong> from Hosur, Tamil Nadu, currently living in Bengaluru. 
        Currently pursuing my <strong>4th year of B.Tech</strong> - Computer Science Engineering at <strong>Dayananda Sagar University</strong>. 
        I’ve always been passionate about technology and enjoy the challenge of <strong>building websites</strong> that are both functional and visually appealing. 
        When I’m not coding, I love playing <strong>cricket</strong>, expressing my creativity through <strong>art</strong>, or playing the <strong>Mridangam</strong> (completed the junior exam).
         I was also part of the <strong>NCC</strong> Junior Wing, which taught me valuable lessons in leadership and discipline. 
         I am fluent in <strong>English, Kannada, Hindi, Tamil</strong>. I’m always eager to learn new things and experience fresh challenges. 
         I’m excited to apply my skills to real-world projects and use technology to make a meaningful impact.</p>
